You must be new here. Why is that? Well, it&#39;s a completely new site, so first things first: please, let me introduce myself! 
<!-- listdesc -->
My name is Csaba Babos, I&#39;m currently working as a frontend developer, but I have started my journey on the game development.
I&#39;m creating some educational webapps for children at work, and I really find it satisfying. However I&#39;ve a childhood dream, and that is to create videogames that I would love to play. </p>
<p>At these days there are many options for creating games, one of them is using Unity3D. It&#39;s free for personal usage and it has powerful features. I&#39;m still learning it, so you can read about it on this blog in time as I learn more and more. </p>
<p>But let me talk a bit more about frontend development, because the main reason I&#39;ve created this blog is to learn various automation systems for frontend developers. 
This will be a not so long journey, but it will worth the time. 
One day I&#39;ve suddenly got to visit a developer&#39;s b:log, probably because he is a big name in frontend development: Remy Sharp. I&#39;ve noticed that he write his posts in Markdown, and <a href="the source of his blog">https://github.com/remy/remysharp.com</a> is available on his <a href="his Github profile">https://github.com/remy</a>. I was surprised, because I couldn&#39;t find any of the tools I&#39;ve used for generating our company&#39;s apps. Actually he used <a href="harp">http://harpjs.com/</a> for generating the static resources (HTML, CSS and so on), and I felt this will be a great starting point for my studies. Remy used a Makefile for initiating the build process and the server, but I thought it&#39;s a bit cleaner if I strict myself to the parts of Node.js.  </p>
<p>I&#39;ve created some minimal requirements for the blog: </p>
<ul>
<li>publishing dates,</li>
<li>published / unpublished states, </li>
<li>list / details views,</li>
<li>version bumping,</li>
<li>static html output,</li>
<li>minimized css,</li>
<li>usage of uncss, because of the heavy size of bootstrap&#39;s css that I&#39;ve used to create the layout</li>
</ul>
<p>After I&#39;ve set up this goals, I&#39;ve created the site in no time. To be honest, this was my first time using <a href="Jade - node template engine">http://jade-lang.com/</a>, but man... It was so damn easy to get it work, I think I&#39;ll stick with it on the next versions of the blog. 
When I wrote these lines, the blog is in version 0.2.2, but with the publish of this article, it will be v1.0.0. It&#39;s finished. The first stable version. It&#39;s a good feeling. But you know how that feels right? :)</p>
<p>Of course I&#39;ll not stop here. Here are the roadmap of the blog&#39;s (and of my knowledge) evolution. </p>
<h2>v2.0.0</h2><p>This will be probably a full rewrite of the blog, but I think it will be fun. Some of the planned features: </p>
<ul>
<li>usage of Grunt as task runner</li>
<li>I&#39;ll stick with Markdown based posts so I&#39;ll need markdown to html parser</li>
<li>LESS for styling the site (as I do right now too) </li>
<li>usage of HTML, CSS, JS linters</li>
<li>of course: I&#39;ll need some HTML, CSS|LESS preprocessor grunt plugins too</li>
<li>I&#39;ll stick with <a href="semver">http://semver.org/</a> versioning</li>
<li>If I save it, I wanna see it, so I&#39;ll use something like browser-sync or LiveReload</li>
<li>I hope there will be enough articles, so I&#39;ll need a pager, I think it will be a Javascript based one, I&#39;ll stick with the frontend only solutions for now</li>
<li>I&#39;ll add the support of tags </li>
<li>An archive feature will be useful I think</li>
</ul>
<h2>v3.0.0</h2><p>This will be an upgrade, and it will use Gulp as the building system. Other feature... I don&#39;t know yet, but I&#39;m sure that I&#39;ll come up with something interesting :)</p>
<h2>v4.0.0</h2><p>This is far away in the future so it&#39;s not a strict promise, but I think this will use Webpack maybe with Gulp, because I don&#39;t want to lose the linting ability and I don&#39;t know if I can do linting with a webpack-based workflow. </p>
<p>Ok that&#39;s all about the blog for now. </p>
<p>This post is a bit longer than I expected, so I&#39;ll cover our current game in a later post. </p>
<p>I hope you didn&#39;t found this article so boring, and You&#39;ll check back later :) </p>
<p>Have a nice day, dear visitor!</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4"><aside><header> <h1>My pens on CodePen </h1></header><div class="pen"><p data-height="286" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="XJxVRL" data-default-tab="result" data-user="cbabos" class="codepen"></p><script async="async" src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script><p>A simple house written purely in CSS3.
