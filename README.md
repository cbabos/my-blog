=================

This is the beginning of developing my personal, and work-related blog. 
The workflow is based on the blog workflow of Remy Sharp, but I wanted an only 
node.js based solution, and of course some challenge for myself :)

It's created using the following tools: 
 - [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
 - [harp](http://harpjs.com/) for compiling and for serving in the develop process

Main features: 
 - posts written in markdown
 - build script to create html from markdown
 - css3 autoprefixer, builder
 - js builder
 - html builder
 - version bump
