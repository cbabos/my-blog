Happy Easter everyone!
===

Hey everyone! It's easter time! Pure happiness for kids, and a great opportunity to be with your parents, but when there is some free time then it's time to experiment a little bit. So I've created a [3D cube](http://codepen.io/cbabos/pen/YPMLBM) with CSS and some CSS 3D transformations, and created a small two state animated [menu icon](http://codepen.io/cbabos/pen/bNywjG). I know, it's easter, but there are no easter eggs :)
