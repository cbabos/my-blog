Why and how I replaced my phone with my laptop (and also: update is coming)
===

So I accidentally broke my Lumia 520. The final attack from the gravity was so lucky, that the phone hit the ground with it's corner, and the touch screen doesn't really touchable anymore. Well, I'm not a big phone-user so there was a couple of solutions for this problem (until I can get a new device). <!--listdesc-->
 - don't have a phone, so I'm only available on the internet via various social networks, and IMs
 - don't have a phone, but get a number for my Skype, and make sure to have a way to call mobile phones from my laptop.

Obviously I had chose the second option, the only problem was to chose the IM that can start calls to mobile phones and landlines to Hungary. There are three solutions for this: Skype, Viber, Google Hangouts. For me, Viber have the lowest prices and the only-ring calls are free to start. So my final solution: Skype Number and Viber Out. I hope this info is actually help others, and thank you if you have read this section anyways :)

Also I've some info about the update for the blog. I've decided to leave out Grunt from the plan, and instead I've jump in to Gulp.
I think everything is ok by now, but one last task that I want to make, is to utilize the gulp-uncss plugin. So there will be a big update for the site soon.
The main features I've achieved:
 - Compile of Jade templates
 - Compile and use Markdown format posts in Jade templates
 - image optimization (gulp-imagemin)
 - using less
 - cleanup the site files before compile
 - gulp-watch and gulp-livereload
 - Using Moment.js for dates
 - Formatted output for gulp tasks in terminal
 - Using the same JSON for generating posts

In the meantime I've switched my main editor from Vim to Atom. I'm very surprised and very satisfied with it. I've used in the past various editors and IDEs, but they were slow, or other problems happend. There are still some very frustrating bugs in Atom, but it's stable, fast, and it has many plugins, themes, functionality that makes my work easier. So... Thank you developers, you did a really great job in my opinion!
