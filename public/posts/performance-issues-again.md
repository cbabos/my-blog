Performance issues again
===

It's been a while but there are some updates that I want to share with you. 
First and most important thing: I have completely rebuilt the whole project in 
favour of performance, and there was a great (a GREAT) profit on that topic. 
But as speed come... speed goes. I don't know that what modification is the
problem, but I've reached a dead end. Again. But it looks like we have achieved
some positive results too :)
