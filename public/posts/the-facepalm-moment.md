That ```facepalm``` moment
===

Okay... So I've finally noticed that I have a really bad focus on my things.
The first post on this blog contained some links to some other pages.
Well... I've simply replaced the link with it's label, so it wasn't reachable...
Please forgive me everybody... And please laugh on it... It was really a
hilarious moment of my life :)

The lesson is: test it, test it, test it. And again. Test it!
